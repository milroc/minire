I never understood why you looked away.
The sunrise is so beautiful this time of year.
You said it was so, but now - what are we to do?
How can we go on, knowing that the commet that we saw that night we spent on the hiltop
together, was nothing more than space junk - a falling communications satelite (perhaps 
even the remnants of MIR).  
Well, if it is this latter case, I guess it's a fitting end.
